# LeetCode 60 Days Roadmap

This repository documents my **60-day LeetCode challenge** — solving one problem per day for two months.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen algorithmic thinking, and prepare for **developer positions in Ottawa**.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Solve **60 LeetCode problems** in **8 weeks**
- Organize problems **by algorithm/topic**
- Write concise solutions and explanations in **English**
- Build a **clean portfolio-ready repository**
